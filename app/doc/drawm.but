\S{cmdDraw} Line Drawing

\G{png.d/bdraw.png} 

The \e{Draw} commands are used to draw lines, arcs and other shapes. 
These can be used to represent water edges, bridges and other scenic features.

There are 4 command buttons on the toolbar used to draw Straight Objects, Curved Lines, Circles and other Shapes.
Each command button is followed by a button that changes the action (and Icon) on the command button.

Some commands display controls on the Status Line (\k{mainW}) to change line width, color or other attributes of the object.

\G{png.d/dcurve3.png} Select the center of the curve and drag to one end.

\b 
\G{png.d/dcurve4.png} Drag from one end of the curve to the other to form the chord of the curve.

Next drag on the Red arrows to adjust the curve.

\S{cmdCircleL} Circles and Filled Circles

\f{Circles} and \f{Filled Circles} are created by selecting either the center position 
or a point on the edge of the circle and dragging to specify the radius.

\b 
\G{png.d/dcircle2.png} 
\G{png.d/dflcrcl2.png} Select a point on the edge of the circle and drag to the center.

\b 
\G{png.d/dbox.png}
\G{png.d/dfilbox.png} \f{Boxes} and \f{Filled Boxes} are created by selecting one corner and dragging the opposite corner.
A \f{Box} is composed of four lines which may be individually deleted.

\b 
\G{png.d/dpoly.png} 
\G{png.d/dfilpoly.png} \f{Poly Lines} and \f{Polygons} are created by \c{LEFT-DRAGGING}, and a corner 
is placed when you release the left mouse button.
The \f{Poly} shape is finished by pressing the \c{SPACE} key or by selecting another operation.

\S{cmdText} Text

\G{png.d/btext.png} 

The \f{Text} command lets you enter text on the layout at the selected position.

The font size can be changed by the Font Size drop list on the \f{Statusbar} (\k{overW}).
The font size is scaled along with everything else on the layout so text is 
always the same relative size as other layout objects.

The font can be selected by the \f{Font Selection} (\k{fontSelW}) dialog invoked by 
the \f{Options>Fonts} menu item or by \c{SHIFT-RIGHT-CLICK} (\k{mouseB}).

You can use the \f{Describe} (\k{cmdDescribe}) command to modify the contents of existing \f{Text} objects.

Note: loading fonts (or changing sizes) can take a noticeable amount of time.

\S{cmdNote} Note

\G{png.d/bnote.png}

The \f{Notepad} command allows you to attach notes to selected places on the 
layout.

Click and drag on the Main Canvas (\k{mainW}) to place the note.

When you release, the \e{Note Editor} dialog is displayed.  
You can enter the note in the text area.

When in Describe (\k{cmdDescribe}) mode, clicking on a \e{Note} will display the 
\e{Property Sheet} to let you read or modify the note.  

\S{cmdRuler} Ruler

\G{png.d/bruler.png} 

The \f{Ruler} command displays a ruler on the layout.  
Click where you want the ruler to begin and drag the cursor to measure 
distances from the origin.  
The measured length is displayed in the \f{Statusbar} (\k{overW}).

You can use the \f{Modify} (\k{cmdModify}) command to change the length of the \f{Ruler}.

Subsequent clicks on the \f{Ruler} button will hide or display the ruler.
