as the default command which is invoked when any other command (if not \f{Sticky} (\k{cmdSticky})) is canceled or 
completed.

\b 
\f{Max Coupling Speed} - trains (\k{cmdTrain}) moving faster than this speed will crash

\f{Right Click} - will either display a popup-menu of available commands or 
command-specific options depending on whether the \f{Shift} key is being held down or not.  
This option allows you to choose which operation occurs.

\S{cmdEasement} Easements

Easements (or spiral transition curves) can be used to connect tracks with 
differing radii.  
This ensures a smooth transition from one track to another and helps prevent 
jerky motion.

Easements can be created every time you \f{Join} (\k{cmdJoin}) tracks, 
\f{Extend} (\k{cmdModify}) a track or create a \f{Tangent} (\k{cmdModify}) track.  
Easements require the possibility to create track with arbitrary radii. Therefore easements
are not possible if sectional track should be used. So it is best to turn \f{Easements} 
off when using sectional track.

When using easements, an error message will be generated if the tracks have a radius 
that is too small or are too short for the transition curve.

The \f{Easement} dialog is invoked from the Options (\k{optionM}) menu.

\G{png.d/easew.png}

\b 
\f{Value} - allows fine tuning of the easement parameters 
(restricted to values >= 0.5).

\b 
\f{R} - minimum radius of the curved track.

\b 
\f{X} - offset between a straight and curved track.

\b 
\f{L} - length of the transition track.

\b 
Radio button group with \f{None}, \f{Sharp}, \f{Normal} and \f{Broad} - corresponding 
to \f{Value}s of 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.  
Select \f{None} to turn off easements.

\f{R}, \f{X} and \f{L} values are read-only.

These values indicate the case of joining a straight 
track with a curve of radius \f{R}.  
The two tracks are separated by the offset \f{X}, and the easement curve extends 
for \f{L/2} inches or centimeters to each side of the endpoints.

The formula used to draw easements is:

\c x = l*l*l / (6*R*L)
\c r = L*R/l

where

\b 
\f{l} is the distance along the tangent to the easement.

\b 
\f{R} is the final radius of the easement.

\b 
\f{L} is the total length of the easement along the tangent.

\b 
\f{x} is the offset from the tangent at \f{l}.

\b 
\f{r} is the radius of easement curve at \f{l}.

The Easement Button on the Main Window (\k{mainW}) changes its label to indicate the current easement value.

The following diagrams illustrates the \f{R}, \f{X} and \f{L} values and the resulting easement curve.

\G{png.d/easeex1.png}

\G{png.d/easeex2.png}

If you use curves with radius larger than \f{R} or are connecting two curves 
(that bend in the same direction) then the easement curve will be shorter and 
the offset smaller.  
If the computed offset is small then no easement is generated.  

A curved track that bends in one direction and then bends in the opposite 
direction is an \e{S-curve}.  
This will generate the worst case easement which is two easement curves 
placed end to end.

\S{fontSelW} Font Selection

\S{cmdSticky} Sticky Dialog

By default, when commands complete, the defined default command (\k{cmdDescribe}) becomes active.
If the command is \f{sticky}, then it remains active after completion.

The \f{Sticky} dialog controls which commands are \f{sticky}.

\G{png.d/sticky.png}

\S{cmdPref} Preferences Dialog

\G{png.d/pref.png}
This dialog controls some parameters which likely will not be changed frequently.

\b 
\f{Check-Point} - how often the layout is automatically saved to the 
checkpoint file (\k{directories}). Setting this value to 0 disables writing the Checkpoint file.

\b 
\f{Units} - chooses English (inches) or Metric (centimeters) measurements.

\b 
\f{Length Format} - controls how lengths are displayed.  Combinations of 
feet and inches (or meters, centimeters and millimeters) with decimal or fractional parts are supported.
\f{Note:} lengths can be entered in any format and are converted on entry.

\b 
\f{Angles} - controls the angle system. \f{Polar}: 0° is up and angles are measured clockwise, or
\f{Cartesian}: 0° is to the right and angles are measured counter-clockwise.

\b 
\f{Minimum Track Length} - specifies the minimum length of a track.
Shorter tracks will not be created.

\b 
\f{Connection Distance} - the maximum distance between endpoints that can be connected.
This affects the \f{Join} (\k{cmdJoin}) command and auto-connection during
\f{Parallel} (\k{cmdParallel})
commands and placing \f{Turnouts} (\k{cmdHotBar}).
Changing this value is not recommended.

\b 
\f{Connection Angle} - as above for the angle between endpoints.

\b 
\f{Drag Distance} - controls how far you can move the cursor (in pixels) 
before XTrkCad considers the action to be a drag instead of a click.

\b 
\f{Drag Timeout} - controls how long you can hold a mouse button down (in milliseconds) 
before XTrkCad considers the action to be a drag instead of a click.

\b 
\f{Auto Pan} - if enabled, dragging near the edge of the Main Canvas (\k{mainW}) will cause the canvas to 
move to follow the mouse.

\b 
\e{List Labels} - controls the format of titles for turnouts and structures displayed in lists 
(such as the \f{Parts List} (\k{cmdEnum})).

\b 
\f{Minimum Track Radius} - Curved tracks with less than this radius are drawn in the exceptional (\k{cmdRgbcolor}) color.

\b 
\f{Maximum Track Grade} - Tracks with more than this grade are drawn in the exceptional (\k{cmdRgbcolor}) color.

\b 
\f{Train Update Delay} - number of milliseconds between updates in the \f{Train Simulation} (\k{cmdTrain}) mode.  
A lower value will generate a smoother display but reduces system responsiveness.

\S{cmdRgbcolor} Colors Dialog

\G{png.d/colorw.png}

The \f{Colors} dialog controls how various objects are drawn.

\b 
\f{Snap Grid} - the Grid displayed by the \f{Grid} (\k{cmdGrid}) dialog.

\b 
\f{Marker} - the short lines drawn on the Ruler of the Main (\k{mainW}) window to indicate
cursor position.

\b 
\f{Border} - the Rulers, Room Boundaries and Table Edges.

\b 
\f{Primary and Secondary Axis} - the large cross displayed when positioning
the \f{Snap Grid} (\k{cmdGrid}) or the \f{Print Grid} (\k{cmdPrint}).

\b 
\f{Normal and Selected Tracks} - color of tracks.

\b 
\f{Profile Path} - color of the path when using the \f{Profile} (\k{cmdProfile}) command.

\b 
\f{Exception Track} - color of \e{Exceptional Tracks} (\k{cmdPref}) which exceed the specified 
grade or are curved to a smaller than the minimum radius.

\b 
\f{Track Ties} - color of ties (if drawn).

Note: on 256 color displays the button color may not be the same as the color 
on the layout due to differences in the way colors are rendered on buttons.
