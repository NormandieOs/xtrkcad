Outstanding problems:

This version is build against gtk-2 and there is 1 known problem

1) If you expand a window, buttons and messages are truncated at the former boundary
   Try dragging on the edge of the main window and notice that the buttons on the button bar
   are truncated.  This might be a problem in wlib/gtklib/gtkwindow.c or gtkmisc.c.

MS-Windows build instructions are pending
