3. Installation on Windows
==========================

XTrackCad has only been tested on Windows XP. We no longer support 
Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 anymore. If you still want to run XTrackCad under 
previous versions of Windows, you'll need Version 3 of XTrackCad.

The MS-Windows version of XTrackCad is shipped as a self-extracting/
self-installing program using the NSIS Installer from Nullsoft Inc.

1) From the WinXP Explorer (or the Run command on the Start menu)
   execute xtrkcad-setup-4.0.3.exe.
   You will be prompted for a destination directory.  A new program group
   with XTrackCad icons will be created.
2) Open the XTrackCad program by double clicking on the icon and try it.
3) The Unistall icon can be used to uninstall XTrackCad.

By default, the installation progranm creates a new directory for the XTrackCad 
Version 4 files. An existing installation of earlier versions of XTrackCad is not 
overwritten. 
A new program group named XTrackCad 4 will be created in the Start menu. 

4. Installation on Linux
========================

0) You will need libc6, X11R6, GTK+2.0, gtkhtml2
1) cd /usr/local/lib
2) tar xvfz ${TMPDIR}/xtrkcad-linux-elf.4.0.1.tar.gz
   ; where TMPDIR is where you downloaded XTrackCad
3) ln -s /usr/local/lib/xtrkcad/xtrkcad /usr/local/bin/xtrkcad ; optional
4) you can use xtrkcad/xtc64.xpm as an icon for XTrackCad if supported by
   your window manager
5) Try it out by running: /usr/local/bin/xtrkcad

5. Upgrade Information
